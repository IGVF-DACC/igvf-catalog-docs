# Genomic Elements
The IGVF Catalog contains genomic elements, which are potential functional regions for regulating gene expression. These elements are identified/tested by functional assays (e.g., MPRA), association studies (e.g., caQTLs), and computational predictions (e.g., the [ENCODE-rE2G model](link)).

## Genomic elements identified/tested by functional assays
* IGVF Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRA)
* ENCODE/IGVF CRISPR
* ENCODE Candidate Cis-Regulatory Elements (cCREs)

## Additional Genomic Elements Collections
## Variants-Genomic Elements Edges
variants associated with genomic elements from:
* caQTL studies: Two external studies ([PMID1](link), [PMID2](link)) curated in [ENCODE portal](link) and [AFGR](link)
* BlueSTARR: computational model predicts variants affecting genomic elements regulatory function 

## Genomic Elements-Genes Edges
* IGVF CRISPR FACS screen and Perturb-seq assays
* ENCODE-rE2G: computational model predicts enhancers, and their target genes and cell types across 1700+ ENCODE biosamples

## Genomic Elements-Biosamples Edges
* IGVF lentiMPRA assays
* ENCODE lentiMPRA assays
