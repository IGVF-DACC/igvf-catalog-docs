# Genomic Elements
The IGVF Catalog contains genomic elements, which are potential functional regions for regulating gene expression. These elements are identified/tested by functional assays (e.g., MPRA), association studies (e.g., caQTLs), and computational predictions (e.g., the [ENCODE-rE2G model](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.09.563812v1.full)).

Data sources include:
* ENCODE Candidate Cis-Regulatory Elements (cCREs)

And other additional edge collections are loaded for genomic elements studied in specific contexts:

## Genomic Elements-Genes Edges
* [IGVF CRISPR FACS screen](link): 
* [IGVF Perturb-seq assays](link):
* [ENCODE-rE2G](link)(can't find a good way to generate a portal link): computational model predicts enhancers, and their target genes and cell types across 1700+ ENCODE biosamples

## Genomic Elements-Biosamples Edges
* [IGVF lentiMPRA assays]()
* [ENCODE lentiMPRA assays](https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=FunctionalCharacterizationExperiment&accession=ENCSR405QCT&accession=ENCSR203UFY&accession=ENCSR336MKI): Elements cloned into the lentiMPRA vector upstream of a minimal promoter, tested potential HepG2, K562, and WTC11 enhancers and promoters of all protein-coding genes.
