## Enhancer-Gene Model Prediction Table

This table shows which genes are predicted to be regulated by enhancers overlapping the variant you're viewing.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Cell Type | The specific cell type for the prediction |
| Target Gene | The gene predicted to be regulated (click to view more details) |
| Score | The strength of the prediction (higher is stronger) |
| Dataset | The source dataset (click for more information) |
| Model | The predictive model used |
| Variant-Gene Distance | Physical distance between the variant and gene |

The table is initially sorted by Score in descending order, showing the strongest predictions first.

## Variants in Linkage Disequilibrium Table

This table displays information about variants that are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the current variant.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| rsID | The reference SNP ID (click for more details) |
| LD (rÂ²) and LD (D') | Measures of linkage disequilibrium |
| Cell Types w/ pred. EG link | Cell types with predicted enhancer-gene links |
| Genes w/ pred. EG link | Genes with predicted enhancer-gene links |
| Ancestry | The population ancestry for the LD information |
| Most Severe Consequence | The predicted functional impact |

You can filter this table by ancestry using the dropdown menu above the table.

## GWAS Association Table

This table shows phenotypes (traits or diseases) associated with the variant through genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Phenotype Term | The associated trait or disease |
| Study Details | Information about the study (ID, name, author, etc.) |
| p-value | The statistical significance of the association |
| Beta | The effect size and direction |

## Coding Variant Prediction Table

If the variant affects a protein-coding region, this table provides predictions about its impact on protein function.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Gene and Transcript Information | Details about the affected gene and transcript |
| Protein Change | How the variant changes the protein sequence |
| Prediction Scores | Various tools' predictions of the variant's impact (higher scores generally indicate more severe impacts) |

Each table can be sorted by clicking on the column headers. You can also use the search box above each table to filter the results.
